<h1># cordova-angular-polymer-seed</h1>

<p>A seed to start a project using Cordova + AngularJS + Polymer</p>
<p>(Note: this isn't an Ionic Framework Seed)</p>

<br/>

<p>Just clone it to you're computer and use it to initialize your projects.
<br/>The directory structure is based on this topic:</p>
  https://scotch.io/tutorials/angularjs-best-practices-directory-structure

<br/>

* <p>When looking for Plugins, you should look in here:</p>
  http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/
<p>But you can also use other plugins from standard cordova or anything else.</p>

<br/>

* <p>There are places in the index.html to load your javascript files on the
bottom of the file, please use it as a guide.</p>

<br/>

* <p>There are places in the index.html to import your polymer modules on the
top of the file, please use it as a guide. All the polymer folders are at www/assets/bower_components/</p>

<br/>

* <p>Any time that you'll use an cordova plugin, put it in a 
document.addEventListener "deviceready" function to make sure that it will
work properly.</p>

<br/>

* <p>The list of icons is in here:</p>

<p>Since this seed is under tests I can't say that I'm sure that it will work as a charm, but until now I can say: It's damn good as killing all Dark Souls bosses without spend souls and without losing then (even that I've never done it, I still can say that I'm sure about it)</p>
